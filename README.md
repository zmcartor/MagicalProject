# Magical Project

Small project illustrating usage of [Magical Record](https://github.com/magicalpanda/MagicalRecord) and [Mogenerator](https://github.com/rentzsch/mogenerator) to create a modern Core Data stack.

### Errata
The build script within the Mogenerator target assumes the mogenerator command-line utility is installed within _/opt/local/bin/mogenerator_ . If this is not the case, change this to your path.
